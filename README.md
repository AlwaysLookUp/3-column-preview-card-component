## Overview
I needed to make a responsive three column preview card component
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements


## My process

1. Starting with laying out divs
2. Naming divs
3. Started CSS
4. Worked on grid layout for desktop
5. Finish design
6. Worked on grid layout for mobile
7. Finished

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned to really utilise free tutorials, courses and asking for help. 


### Continued development

Next steps is to continue learning cssgrid, flexbox and designs and continue working on new challenges. 



### Useful resources

- [Wes Bos CSS Grid Course](https://www.cssgrid.io) - This helped me understand CSS Grid and I would reccomend it to anyone learning css grid especially when it's free.
